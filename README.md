# beq_categorization
Categorization of klingon words, to be used via beq (or something else, I guess?)

First working draft - I'm sure I'm not using Azure Table Storage correctly, but so far it seems to work. I'm not used to Visual Studio Code, Azure, or Table storage...

Since beq works in JavaScript, maybe storing as JSon can be useful? I can directly read the Json-Data in beq.
